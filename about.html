    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Pavithra, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I specialize in creating intuitive, user-friendly websites and applications that solve real-world problems. With a focus on clean code and responsive design, I strive to ensure that every project I work on is both functional and visually appealing.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies, working on side projects, and collaborating with others to bring creative ideas to life. Whether it's building a dynamic web application, designing a simple landing page, or developing an AI-driven system, Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
